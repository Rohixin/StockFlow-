### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js (LTS recommended)](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace with your repo URL
    cd my-stock-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Grab Your Alpha Vantage API Key:**
    * Head over to [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and quickly sign up for your **free API key**. It's your passport to market data!
    * **Copy** that unique key.

4.  **Inject Your API Key:**
    * Open the file: `src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`
    * Locate this line:
        ```typescript
        const ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY'; // <<< REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ACTUAL KEY!
        ```
    * **Carefully replace `'YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY'` with your actual API key.** Make sure it's snugly inside the single quotes!
        *Example:* `const ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_GOES_HERE';`

### Launch StockFlow!

1.  **Fire up the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Open in your browser:**
    * Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the address your terminal shows) and watch StockFlow come to life!

### üí° A Note on Data & Your Free Tier API

* **Alpha Vantage Free Tier Limits:** Remember, the free tier comes with a speed limit (typically 5 requests/minute, 500/day). If you're hitting "API limit exceeded" errors, give it a few minutes or hours.
* **Market Hours Magic:** True "real-time" (1-minute delayed) data only flows when markets are open (Mon-Fri). Outside these hours, StockFlow will gracefully switch to displaying the latest **daily historical data**.
* **Premium Symbols:** Some specific international stocks or advanced data sets might be premium. If you hit a "Premium Endpoint" error, try well-known US stock symbols like `IBM`, `AAPL`, or `MSFT` ‚Äì they're usually free-tier friendly!
